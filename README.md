# REACT STATER APP

This is only a starter app with a NavBar and React Router built in. So that I can pull this one in and remove the all
reference to .git and push the content into the new create-react-app project

## Available Scripts

All branches also have the same thing. Plz don't push code to this one or any of the branches. This is only to create
a Started Project
